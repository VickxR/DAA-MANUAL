# Design and Analysis of Algorithms Lab (CS23331)

This repository contains programs and solutions related to **Design and Analysis of Algorithms (DAA)**, focusing on **C programming basics**, time complexity analysis, and algorithmic strategies like divide-and-conquer, dynamic programming, and greedy approaches. The code samples were extracted and structured from lab exercises, including various problems and solutions.
